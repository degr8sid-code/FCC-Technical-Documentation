                        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
                        is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
                        example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                        its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                    </p>
                    <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
                        and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
                        structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
                        variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
                        example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                                to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
                                client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
                                HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                                and page navigation.
                                </li>

                                    Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                                    relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
                                    extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                                    provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
                                    the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
